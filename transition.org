* Introduction

  This document seeks to analyse the current collapse of the global economic, political and social systems, describe their root causes, provide summaries of already existing theories (such as the Fourth turning and others) and offer prognosis.

  What most prognosis are missing is considering the overall energetic climate. We cannot just "do anything", that's not how things work. There are different cosmic energies coming to Earth at different times and we have to work within them. I will try to syncretise between systems, but I found Human design's description to the Cross of Sleeping Phoenix particularly enlightening.

  The objective of this document is not to spread fear: it may trigger such reaction in people, but personally I see this as a long-overdue transition that will reset the balance in the world and will take us from greed and usurpance towards humility and connection: to the Earth, the Spirit and each other. By getting an understanding of these changes, we are able to build systems that will allow us to thrive and prosper in the coming era.

** How are things going?
*** Financial system collapse

  Imagine a world where your money still exists on a screen — but it buys you less every week. This is already happening: the dollar, once the pillar of global trade, is being abandoned quietly by countries striking deals in their own currencies. Meanwhile, debt has piled up so high that even the US struggles to pay interest without printing more money, devaluing it further. As trust erodes, so does the global web of trade and stability it underpins. Without a trusted financial heart, the arteries of food, fuel, and materials clog and break. Collapse isn’t about Wall Street crashing in a day; it’s about daily life slowly grinding to a halt as nothing quite works anymore.

*** End of cheap oil

  Energy is like oxygen for civilisation: invisible, taken for granted, vital. Yet the era of cheap, easily-extracted oil — the kind that built cities, grew food, and powered armies — is over. What’s left is dirtier, harder to reach, and more expensive. Shale oil kept the illusion alive for a while, but it’s faltering. Every time oil prices spike, everything else does too: food, transport, medicine. Think of it this way: without affordable oil, feeding cities like Mexico City or New York becomes an engineering nightmare, not a routine operation. And no amount of solar panels or wishful thinking can rebuild that overnight.

*** Water scarcity

  Imagine Cape Town, 2018: a modern city almost reaching “Day Zero,” when taps would run dry and citizens would line up with buckets. Now multiply that. Cities from Los Angeles to São Paulo to parts of India are running unsustainably on vanishing groundwater and shrinking rivers. Climate chaos accelerates the problem, but the real killer is overuse. Farms and cities alike are pumping water faster than nature can replenish. When the water runs out, life doesn’t “adjust” — it collapses. No water, no food, no industry. And the migrations, conflicts, and chaos that follow won’t respect borders.

*** Soil degradation

  Picture the American Midwest, once the world’s breadbasket, now losing soil 10 to 50 times faster than nature can rebuild it. This is not just about dust; it’s about the collapse of the living skin of the Earth. Without rich topsoil, crops fail even if it rains and even if seeds are sown. Add chemical dependence and monocultures, and the soil turns to sterile dust or poison. When Rome fell, it was partly because its farms wore out the land. Today, the stakes are global. You can’t print new soil or replace it with machines. When the soil dies, so does civilisation.

*** Extreme weather

  Floods that used to happen once a century now drown cities every few years. Droughts parch once-fertile lands into cracked deserts. Heatwaves cook crops in the fields and kill thousands in places where air conditioning was once thought unnecessary. From California’s year-round fire season to Pakistan’s drowned fields, extreme weather is no longer “extreme” — it’s the new background hum. Infrastructure built for a mild, stable climate cannot cope: roads buckle, grids fail, houses wash away. As weather becomes unpredictable, everything depending on predictability — farming, logistics, insurance, governance — begins to fray.

** The age of self-destruction

  It doesn't take a genius to know that things are just not alright. The few examples from above are to drive that point home, but it's something we all deep down know: that what is going on is not sustainable. It's the greed that fuels more destruction and moral bankrupcy. Moral bankrupcy is a great litmus test of where we are at.

  With the rather sour environment of highly abusing social networks, lying influencers being admired as stars, ever-present lobbying being able to pay their way for governments to (gladly) turn the blind eye to ecological problems and mainly, lying, deceit and "not my problem" attitude so ever present, I think we can quite safely say that we are, quite literaly living in the last days of Rome.

  Please note that this isn't simplistic thinking, suggesting that there's a direct correlation between moral environment and deeper and wider systemic collapse. All is connected. If you have a farm and take soil samples in 10 random spots and they all look similar, the chance is that's how the whole soil underneath the farm is like. And as shown in the examples above, the system is rotten from the inside out.

  Our mindset is the root of what we do. If we seeks to enrich ourselves on the expense of others, people and land alike, we will design systems that will allow us just that (spoiler: that's the cornerstone of current dollar-based economics). However, these systems have that "moral rot" embedded in them and are ultimately brittle and due to fail.

  Perhaps, this link may not be so readily understood by everyone. It's superficially obvious to a certain point, but the true depth of this is very hard to see. Any kind of (true) spiritually, be it about harmony with nature such as in Shamanism or Indian sage's path to enlightenment will make one (eventually) trully appreciate this. I will keep exploring this topic in the following chapters.

  Anyway here comes the punchline:

    The system we built depends on infinite extraction and infinite growth in a finite, living world that cannot support either.

** Oneness: the antidote to greed and destruction

  In the beginning, human beings lived naturally within Oneness. There was no sharp division between self and world, between the river and the one who drank from it, between the tree and the one who rested under it. Life simply was, and it was enough. The land, the animals, the seasons, the community — all were part of one living whole, and value was not separated from life itself. There was no need to think about meaning, ownership, or control; existence was its own fulfilment.

  Over time, however, a sense of separation crept in. Humans began to see themselves as distinct from the rest of life, standing apart rather than within. From this separation grew fear, desire, and the urge to possess and control. Wealth shifted from being the natural abundance of life to symbols that could be accumulated — gold, money, property — even at the cost of harming the very life that once sustained them. The original unity was forgotten, and in its place arose the endless pursuit of abstract value, setting the stage for exploitation, ecological destruction, and inner emptiness.

  Many traditions have preserved the memory of this lost Oneness. In the Bible, Adam and Eve’s expulsion from Eden symbolises the moment when innocence gave way to self-conscious grasping. In Buddhism, the endless cycle of craving and suffering — Samsara — arises from mistaking illusion for reality. In Hinduism, the age of Kali Yuga marks the decline into conflict and forgetting. Across cultures, the message is clear: paradise was not a place, but a state of being in harmony with life, and separation from it is the root of all suffering.

  John Milton’s Paradise Lost echoes this deep pattern. It portrays how pride, the desire for independence from the whole, leads to a tragic exile from natural harmony. It is not merely a religious tale but a psychological truth: the loss of Oneness brings sorrow, but it also plants the seed of longing. Through awareness, humility, and remembrance, we are called to find our way back — not to the unconscious unity we once had, but to a conscious reunion with life, where value and life are once again one.

  When balance is lost, life naturally seeks to heal itself, but not by snapping back to the past. A river that overflows its banks does not forget how to flow; it simply finds a deeper, steadier channel over time. In the same way, when humanity strayed too far into separation and pride, the answer was never to erase individuality, but to deepen it within a greater awareness of unity. True restoration is not a return to unconscious innocence, nor a collapse into chaos, but the growth of a strong tree rooted in both earth and sky. Life moves through excess and correction, but always tends toward a living centre — a conscious Oneness where both freedom and belonging are fulfilled.

  We have strayed too far one way, it's only inevitable now that life will self-correct, whether we like it or not.

** How global economy works
*** Mechanics of the Global Economy and Globalisation

The global economy is the system of interlinked national economies, connected through flows of trade, finance, labour, and resources. When a farmer grows wheat in the US, sells it to China, and China uses the earned dollars to buy US bonds, we are seeing global economic interdependence in action. This integration increases efficiency but also systemic fragility, as local crises can ripple worldwide.

Globalisation is the historical process that accelerates this integration. It began with early colonial trading companies like the Dutch and British East India Companies in the 16th–17th centuries, expanded with the Industrial Revolution and colonial empires in the 19th century, and matured post-1945 through managed globalisation (Bretton Woods system). After 1990, deregulation and financial technologies led to hyperglobalisation: instant capital flows, fragmented supply chains, and high interdependency.

Key drivers of globalisation include:
- Lowering trade barriers (tariffs, regulations).
- Expanding financial systems and institutions (IMF, World Bank, WTO).
- Constructing global supply chains for cost efficiency.

*** Unsustainability: Fiat, Globalisation, and the Separation of Value from Life

The roots of modern unsustainability lie deeper than fiat money or globalisation policies. They are symptoms of an older fracture: the metaphysical separation of value from life.

Originally, value was directly tied to life: the fertility of land, the health of herds, the productivity of labour. Wealth was tangible, seasonal, and grounded in the realities of survival and interdependence with nature. Over time, however, value became abstracted into symbols — first money, then shares, debts, financial derivatives — which could be traded, speculated upon, and accumulated independently of life's natural rhythms.

This separation has profound consequences:
- Fiat currency enables theoretically infinite money creation, untethered from physical production or land.
- Globalisation enables the commodification and extraction of life — labour, ecosystems, communities — for maximum financial return.
- Speculation becomes detached from physical stewardship or regenerative cycles.

Fiat money fuels hyperglobalisation by providing abundant, mobile capital chasing speculative profits. Globalisation, in turn, externalises the true costs onto distant lands, exploited workers, and the degraded environment.

*** Gold Standard, Great Depression, and Monetary Rigidity

Under the classical gold standard (pre-1914), currencies were pegged to gold reserves. This theoretically limited inflation and disciplined governments from overspending. However, it also introduced dangerous rigidity: when the economy expanded, the money supply could not expand fast enough; when a crisis hit, liquidity could not be injected flexibly.

The post-WWI attempts to return to the gold standard at overvalued exchange rates exacerbated this problem. When the 1929 stock market crash occurred, the gold anchor prevented central banks from expanding credit, deepening the global depression.

The core lesson is that:
- Excessive monetary rigidity suffocates the real economy in times of stress.
- Excessive monetary looseness (fiat without constraint) leads to delusion, bubbles, and collapse.

Thus, monetary systems must stay in balance with the living economy: tied enough to reality to maintain trust, but flexible enough to respond to life's natural volatility.

*** Globalisation: Sustainability or Exploitation?

In theory, globalisation could have enabled a more interconnected, cooperative world where cultures exchange goods, knowledge, and technologies for mutual benefit. In practice, it has almost always favoured speculation and exploitation.

Globalisation as practised involves:
- Capital speculating on short-term profits without responsibility for long-term outcomes.
- Labour arbitrage: shifting production to wherever wages, protections, and ecological regulations are weakest.
- Ecological degradation and social disintegration as externalised costs.

A sustainable form of globalisation would require:
- True-cost accounting (internalising ecological and human costs).
- Strengthened local resilience and autonomy.
- Ethical, ecological, and financial limits on speculative capital movements.

In the absence of these structures, globalisation today operates fundamentally as an exploitative system, undermining its own foundations.

*** Fiat: Root Cause or Symptom?

Fiat money is not the original cause of systemic unsustainability. It is an accelerant — a mechanism that magnifies deeper forces already at play.

The deeper root is the metaphysical separation of value from life itself. Even before fiat currencies, we see speculative bubbles (e.g., the Dutch tulip mania), exploitative colonial trade, and financialised abstraction through bonds and stock companies. Fiat merely removes the last remaining brakes, enabling infinite financial abstraction with no real-world constraints.

The structure of the issue can be summarised:
- Fiat = accelerant
- Globalisation = network
- Speculation and exploitation = dynamic
- Separation of value from life = original cause

*** Final Framing

The crises of today — financial instability, ecological collapse, social fragmentation — are not merely the result of "bad money" or "bad policies." They are the terminal symptoms of a civilisation that, centuries ago, chose to pursue infinite accumulation of symbolic wealth while abandoning stewardship of the living Earth.

Until value is once again re-anchored in life — land, ecosystems, communities, real production — any system, whether gold-based or fiat-based, will remain fundamentally unstable and unsustainable.
